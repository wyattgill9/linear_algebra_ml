# High-Performance Linear Algebra Library for ML

A Rust library for high-performance linear algebra operations, optimized for machine learning workloads.

## Features

- [ ] Dense matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, etc.).
- [ ] Sparse matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, etc.).
- [ ] BLAS integration (Level 1, 2, and 3 operations).
- [ ] LAPACK integration (SVD, LU, QR decompositions).
- [ ] GPU acceleration (CUDA and Vulkan backends).
- [ ] Benchmarks for performance testing.
- [ ] Unit tests for correctness.
